# Pytorch Examples

PyTorch is software, specifically a machine learning library for the programming language Python, based on the Torch library,
used for applications such as deep learning and natural language processing.It is primarily developed by 
Facebook's artificial-intelligence research group,and Uber's Pyro probabilistic programming language software is 
built on it.[8] It is free and open-source software released under one of the BSD licenses.

*PyTorch provides two high-level features:*

> 1. Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU)   
> 2. Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autodiff system
